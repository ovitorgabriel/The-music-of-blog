            <p>I thought my heart had felt it all
                <br>I swam for miles across the ocean
                <br>Never met the shore
                <br>My eyes were closed, my highs were lows
                <br>Just gettin' drunk on pills and potions
                <br>Cravin' something more
                <br>Traveled the world but it got me nowhere
                <br>Nothing could ever compare
                <br>A kiss, a touch, a song that made me cry
                <br>And all the drugs I've done, they never got me higher
                <br>Than the first time we met
                <br>There's nothing like the first time we met
                <br>I crashed my car, oh, baby, I was flyin
                <br>And I talked to God, He couldn't get me higher
                <br>Than the first time we met
                <br>There's nothing like the first time, the first time we met
                <br>That night, the stars aligned, Heaven dropped a line
                <br>Before you, I was just a flare in the sky
                <br>A kid too afraid to go to play in the light
                <br>A colorless painter, a man with no sight
                <br>Before you, I was nothin', was nothin'
                <br>Had nothin', I only had
                <br>A kiss, a touch, a song that made me cry

                <br>Than the first time we met

                <br>There's nothing like the first time, the first time we met
                <br>You set the room on fire
                <br>You take the angels higher
                <br>I heard a thousand choirs
                <br>Oh, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet
                <br>Traveled the world, it got me nowhere
                <br>Nothing could ever compare

            <br>When we're grey and old?
            <br>'Cause I have been told
            <br>That salvation lets their wings unfold
            <br>So when I'm lying in my bed
            <br>Thoughts running through my head
            <br>And I feel that love is dead
            <br>I'm loving angels instead
            <br>And through it all she offers me protection
            <br>A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
            <br>And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
            <br>I know that life won't break me
            <br>When come to call, she won't forsake me
            <br>I'm loving angels instead
            <br>When I'm feeling weak
            <br>And my pain walks down a one way street
            <br>I look above
            <br>And I know I'll always be blessed with love
            <br>And as the feeling grows
            <br>She brings flesh to my bones
            <br>And when love is dead
            <br>I'm loving angels instead
            <br>And through it all she offers me protection
            <br>A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
            <br>And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
            <br>I know that life won't break me
            <br>When I come to call, she won't forsake me
            <br>I'm loving angels instead
            <br>And through it all she offers me protection
            <br>A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
            <br>And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
            <br>I know that life won't break me
            <br>When I come to call, she won't forsake me
            <br>I'm loving angels instead</p>
